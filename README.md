# 42_get_next_line
This is a project from the 42 school curriculum that I completed, which involves implementing a function to read and return a line from a file descriptor.
<p></p>
The function is designed to handle multiple file descriptors and read only the necessary amount of data. It provides a reliable and efficient solution for reading data from various types of files.

### Installation
To use this function, simply include the get_next_line.c file in your project and call the get_next_line() function, passing in the file descriptor of the file you wish to read from.

### Usage
The get_next_line() function returns a line from the specified file descriptor, one line at a time, until the end of the file is reached. The function automatically handles memory allocation and deallocation for the returned line.

## Notice
This project follows the 42School coding standard, which may result in unusual implementation choices. While efforts have been made to optimize certain areas, there is always room for improvement.
